# FAQ. Payment

Plans can be paid in **US dollars or in euros** using any bank card or your PayPal account. View the current pricing here: [plans.md](plans.md "mention").

* **Can I pay in another currency?**\
  We accept payments in **US dollars only**.\
  If your card is in a different currency, the amount will be **automatically converted** at your bank’s exchange rate.

### Plans and promo codes

* **What’s the difference between domain payment and plan payment?**\
  Plan payment includes access to Wfolio features: the website builder and cloud drive (or just the cloud drive).\
  The domain (your website’s web address) is paid for separately.
* **Where can I enter a promo code?**\
  Send us a message in the support chat—we’ll activate the promo code for you.
* **I have a 35% promo code. Why doesn’t the monthly price change?**\
  The discount applies only to the first annual payment.
* Can I use the promo code multiple times?\
  Yes, a promo code can only be used for your **first annual payment**. To continue saving on renewals, you can use the [invite-friend.md](invite-friend.md "mention").
* **If I pay monthly now, will the yearly discount still be available later?**\
  Yes. The 35% discount on your first annual payment will remain valid for as long as you’re on a monthly plan.
* **Why was the price lower last year?**\
  The first annual payment includes a one-time discount.\
  You can also use the **referral program** to get free access by inviting others to Wfolio: [invite-friend.md](invite-friend.md "mention").

### Auto-renewal (automatic payments)

* **Why is auto-renewal enabled?**\
  Auto-renewal ensures your site and domain stay online without interruption and remain accessible to your clients.\
  A notice is shown during checkout about auto-renewal, and you’ll receive email notifications about its activation and any card charges.
* **How do I disable auto-renewal?**\
  Go to **Settings →** **Plan** and click on the **Turn off** button in the **Next payment** section.
* **How do I enable auto-renewal?**\
  Pay for your plan by clicking **Pay with card**. Auto-renewal will be enabled automatically.
* **Can I view the card number linked to auto-renewal?**\
  Currently, this isn’t possible.\
  To use a different card, disconnect the current one from your account, then make a payment with the new card—this will link auto-renewal to it.
