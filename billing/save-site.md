# How to keep a website during a temporary non-payment

### What happens if you don’t pay on time

If your plan is not paid, it will be suspended, and your website and galleries will become inaccessible.

Wfolio allows you to **preserve your website data** during a temporary non-payment period.\
Once the plan is paid again, your site content will be **restored**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note: this only applies to website pages.

Galleries are **moved to the trash after 7 days** of plan suspension and **permanently deleted after another 7 days**.
{% endhint %}

### How to extend website storage

Go to your admin panel at [**wfolio.com/my**](https://wfolio.com/my). After logging in, click the **extend →** link.

Make sure to log in to your admin panel **at least once a month** to keep your website data safe.

### Saving data during the trial period

Clicking on the **Reset and restart the trial** will permanently delete all data in your account and start a new trial period. <mark style="color:red;">**Do not use this option if you want to keep your work.**</mark>

If your account was blocked during the trial, please contact support—we’ll help you restore access.
