# Trial period and payment

### **Trial period**

The trial period is provided for 8 days. During this time, you can try out all the functions of the platform without restrictions.

After the end of the trial period, access to the control panel is blocked. You can pay for the plan or delete the data and start the trial period over. You have 30 days to make a decision to pay for the website and 7 days to pay for the drive.

### **Payment**

You can pay for the website in the control panel in the **Settings → Plans & billing**. There are two payment options: once a year or once a month.

**The domain is paid for and extended separately** from the plan. Learn more: [new.md](../domain/new.md "mention").

### Auto-renewal

After paying for the plan or domain, auto-renewal is automatically enabled. It can be disabled manually in the **Settings → Plans & billing**.

{% hint style="info" %}
With auto-renewal, payment attempts begin **5 days before the end of the current billing period** to check for available funds on the linked card.

The new billing cycle starts **from the end of the previous paid period**.
{% endhint %}

### Extending your payment deadline

If you can’t pay before the end of your billing period, you can extend your plan in the **Settings → Plans & billing**.\
You can extend it for up to **14 days**—two extensions of 7 days each.

The option becomes available if there are **fewer than 5 days** left on your plan.

To extend your plan, click the link next to the plan’s expiration date and confirm the extension.

{% columns %}
{% column %}
On free and trial plans, the link will say **Extend for 7 days**

{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}
On paid plans, the link will say \
**Pay in 7 days**

{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For paid plans. extensions are counted toward your **next payment**.

For example:\
On **March 1, 2025**, you click on the **Pay in 7 days** and extend your plan until **March 8, 2025**.\
When you later pay for the plan, the validity will extend until **April 1, 2025**—the 7-day extension will be included in your new billing cycle.
{% endhint %}

### Refund

Refunds are possible within 14 days after payment. For a refund, please contact the support team.
