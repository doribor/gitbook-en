# 120 GB for free

**Client Gallery** is a service where you can share photos with clients beautifully, increase your income, and attract new clients without advertising expenses. It simplifies your interactions with clients and makes it more effective. With the help of our Galleries you can create personal galleries, select pictures for retouching, and sell photos and photo books.

### How to get a free plan

* **Upload the photos that you want to share with your client.** You can also upload videos.
* **Make a post or create a reel on Instagram** on how you share photos via the Galleries with a mention of our **Instagram account** [**@wfolio.gallery**](https://instagram.com/wfolio.gallery)**.** \
  Attach a screenshot or a video of your gallery in the preview mode. The post needs to show how your gallery looks like from your clients' perspective.
