# How to change the plan

There are two plan options on Wfolio: [**Drive Only**](plans.md#drive-only-plan) and [**Site + Drive**](plans.md#site--drive-plan). You can add more options to your current plan or switch from one plan to another on the **Settings → Plans & billing** page.

Here, you can renew your current plan, change payment method, upgrade your plan, or switch to a different plan.

## How to change the plan

Depending on your current plan, different options are available.

You can upgrade your current plan without switching to another plan line:

* **On the Site + Drive plan**, you can upgrade your cloud storage to unlimited or remove the “Site by Wfolio” label.
* **On the Drive Only plan**, you can expand your storage. Available options: **240 GB, 1000 GB, Unlimited Drive**.

You can also switch plans:&#x20;

* Upgrade to the **Site + Drive** plan which includes website-building features alongside client galleries.
* Switch to the **Drive Only** plan — client galleries without the website-builder.

If the new plan is cheaper than your current one, no payment is needed. If you switch to a more expensive plan, you only need to pay the difference between the two plans.

When upgrading or switching your plan, choose your billing cycle: monthly or yearly.

If you switch plans, any **first-year discount** remains valid.
{% endhint %}

## How to change the payment method

In the **Plans and Billing** section, you can manually renew your plan: link a new card and choose a billing cycle — monthly or yearly.
