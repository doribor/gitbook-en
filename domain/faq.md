# FAQ. Domains

#### What is a domain?

A **domain** is the address of your website or galleries on the internet. You can connect a free .wfolio.pro domain to your site or register a custom domain through Wfolio or any domain registrar.

{% content-ref url="new.md" %}
[new.md](new.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### I already have a domain. Can I connect it?

Yes! You just need to configure the domain in your registrar's control panel.

{% content-ref url="existing-domain.md" %}
[existing-domain.md](existing-domain.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### Does Wfolio offer free domains?

Yes! When you sign up, you automatically receive a free domain in the format: `yourmail.wfolio.pro`.\
You can change this to another free `.wfolio.pro` domain at any time.

#### **What is a subdomain? Can I connect two websites to one domain?**

A **subdomain** is a separate section of your main domain—a subsite that works independently. For example: if your main domain is `site.com`, your subdomains could be `gallery.site.com` or `works.site.com`.

A subdomain is useful if you need a second website or an additional cloud drive for galleries.

{% content-ref url="subdomain.md" %}
[subdomain.md](subdomain.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### **How do I add DNS records?**

* If your domain is registered [through Wfolio](new.md) or connected via [Wfolio DNS](existing-domain.md#specify-wfolio-servers-as-dns-servers), contact our support team, and we'll add the records for you.
* If your domain is connected [via A records](existing-domain.md#add-or-edit-a-records-in-the-dns-editor), you'll need to add DNS records manually in your domain registrar's settings.

#### Can I connect two domains to one website?

**One Wfolio site or drive can have only one domain (or subdomain).**

However, you can set up a redirect from one domain to another. Visitors who access the first domain will be redirected to the second domain.

{% hint style="info" %}
* The redirect will remain active until the first domain expires.
* If both domains use **.wfolio.pro**, **redirects are not possible**.
{% endhint %}

To set up a domain redirect, contact Wfolio support.

#### Do I need to pay for hosting separately?

No! Hosting is included for free with your Wfolio plan and domain purchase.

#### I received a message that my domain is connected, but my website won't load

Domains and **SSL certificates** take up to **48 hours** to fully activate. If everything is set up correctly, please wait. Your site or drive will be accessible soon.

#### It's been more than 48 hours, and my website still isn't loading

Contact our support via your control panel or social media. We will help you fix the issue.

#### My website works, but the connection is not secure

Contact our support, and we will help you.

#### Why isn't my website appearing in search engines?

**Search engines take at least 3-4 weeks** to index a newly connected domain. To speed up indexing, connect **Google Search Console**.
