# New domain registration

A domain name is a unique web address, like `mydomain.com`, that directs users to your **website or gallery** when entered in a browser.

Every Wfolio account comes with a [free domain](new.md#free), such as `yourmail.wfolio.com`, which you can use for your website or galleries. However, if you want to enhance your brand's credibility and make your links look more professional, registering a [custom domain name](new.md#new-domain-registration) is highly recommended.

{% endhint %}



## Choosing a domain name <a href="#name" id="name"></a>

Here are a few tips to help you make your choice:

1. **Keep it simple**. Choose a domain that is **easy to read, remember, and pronounce**. A clear and straightforward name makes it easier for visitors to recall.
2. **Avoid long words**. Shorter domains are **more memorable**. Consider abbreviations, such as **photo** instead of **photographer**.
3. **Match your brand**. If you have a business, studio, or personal brand, incorporate its name into the domain to strengthen **brand recognition**.
4. **Minimize special characters**. Avoid **numbers and hyphens** whenever possible. They can make a domain harder to read and remember. If you must use a hyphen, **stick to just one**.
5. **Double-Check Spelling**. **Domains cannot be changed** after purchase. Carefully review the name before registering to avoid costly mistakes.

## New domain registration

You can register and pay for a domain name in the `.com` or `.me` zone on Wfolio. You can also connect a [free domain](new.md#free) `.wfolio.pro`.

* Enter your desired domain name and press **Select**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Unavailable** domains have already been registered and are unavailable for purchase.
{% endhint %}

* Choose a domain in the `.com` or `.me` zone and complete the purchase.

Your **new domain** will be connected within a few hours. Any links using your old `.wfolio.pro` address will **automatically redirect** to the new domain.



## How to connect a free domain <a href="#free" id="free"></a>

When you sign up on Wfolio, you automatically receive a free domain (e.g., `yourmail.wfolio.pro`). You can change it to a different free domain at any time:

* Go to **Settings → Site Address** (or **Disk Web Address**).
* Click **Connect Domain**.
* Enter a new domain name and click **Select**.
* Click **Connect** next to the `.wfolio.pro` domain.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Changing your `.wfolio.pro` to another `.wfolio.pro` domain means **old links will no longer work**. They will not redirect to your new domain, so be sure to share updated links with your clients.
