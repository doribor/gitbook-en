# How to choose a beautiful domain

A domain (domain name) is an address on the Internet with the help of which you can open the website or drive in a browser.

Wfolio gives temporary domains to all clients. They look something like this: **yourmail.wfolio.com**. You can use it for your website or drive. But if you want your business to be taken seriously and the links that you send to your clients to look remarkable, you need to create a name for your domain and then register it.

Domain registration in the .com zone costs $19.90 for the first year (extension costs $28.90/year). You can also connect a free domain, such as mydomain.wfolio.pro. Here's the manual for it in 📖 **How to register a new domain**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Be careful when choosing a domain and check the correctness of the words before buying. If you make a typo in a domain name, this typo cannot be corrected because there isn't a possibility to edit the name of a registered domain. **After the purchase, the domain can be changed, but the registration of a new domain will need to be paid.** The old domain will automatically redirect visitors to the new one until the end of the paid period for the first domain.

### **How to choose a beautiful domain?**

Here are a few tips to help you make your choice:

1. **Simplicity.** Ideally, a domain should be simple, easy to remember, and easy to hear. Make sure the domain is easy to read, so visitors will be more likely to remember it.
2. **Abbreviations**. Avoid too many characters. The shorter the domain, the easier it is to remember. Shorten words in the domain. For example, instead of _photographer_, you can use _photo_.
3. **Matching the brand name.** If you have an official company, brand, or studio name, it's best to write it in your domain. So visitors will remember your brand better.
4. **Less characters.** It's better not to use numbers and hyphens in the domain. It's easier to read domains without numbers and hyphens, or with just one hyphen.
5. **Spelling.** Check the domain name carefully before buying. The domain name cannot be changed after purchase. You will only have the option to buy a new domain.



### What will happen to my old links?

If you have already shared links to your website or to your projects on drive with a domain that ends with **.wfolio.pro**, the old links will redirect visitors to the new ones.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that a redirection from a free .wfolio.pro domain will only work if you register and purchase a paid domain. It will not work if you change your address from one free domain to another.
