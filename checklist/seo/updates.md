# SEO: Content updates

Regularly updating content on a photographer’s website is essential for maintaining visitor interest and improving visibility in search engine results. Fresh photos, recent projects, and helpful blog posts not only showcase your professionalism and growth but also help attract new clients. An active website signals that you’re passionate about your work and constantly evolving.

### You use _Previews_ or _Blog_ sections

Keep your content fresh by consistently updating the [_Announcements_](../../site/stories/previews.md) or _Blog_ sections of your site. Search engines prioritize websites with recent and relevant information, which boosts your visibility in search.

These sections are also a great way to share photo shoots and valuable insights with your audience. Any session, story, or practical tip can become the foundation of a great post.

### Post titles include relevant keywords

Use keywords in your post titles—this helps search engines better understand and index your content.\
For example, if your website focuses on wedding photography, potential keywords could be: _wedding photographer_, _photo session_, _couple shoot_, etc. Including specific phrases in post titles improves their relevance and visibility in search results.

### Location is mentioned in headlines and text

Mentioning the location of the shoot (geo-targeting) in your post titles and content improves local SEO. For example, post titles might include: _**Wedding photography in Chicago**_ or _**Engagement shoot in Central Park**_. This helps you reach a local audience and rank higher in location-based search queries.

### Posts include both photos and text

It’s important that your posts feature not just images, but also written content. Search engines rely heavily on text to evaluate and rank pages. Adding descriptions, stories, and helpful tips related to the photos greatly enhances SEO.

Make sure your texts are unique, informative, and include relevant keywords — common phrases that reflect your photography niche.

### New pages are added regularly

Regularly updating your [_Previews_](../../site/stories/previews.md) or _Blog_ section plays a significant role in improving your site’s SEO. A steady stream of new content shows search engines that your site is well-maintained and active. It also keeps your audience engaged.
