# SEO: Galleries

Using the Wfolio galleries is a reliable and convenient way to manage your photo projects. Galleries hosted on the drive look stunning and professional. You can easily create selection lists for retouching or printing, download original-size images, or use smaller versions optimized for social media. The platform also allows you to sell individual photos or products.

Browsing through projects on the drive encourages your clients to spend more time on your site, which positively impacts user behavior metrics—a key factor in search engine optimization.

### User engagement boosts SEO

The more pages a visitor views and the longer they stay on your site while interacting with your content, the more favorably search engines will treat your website.

The galleries is not just a tool for viewing, selecting, and delivering photos — they also play a vital role in increasing user engagement and supporting your site’s SEO performance.
