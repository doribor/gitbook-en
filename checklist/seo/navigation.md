# SEO: Navigation and website structure

A well-organized website structure is not just about convenience—it’s a key factor for success in search engine rankings. A clear structure improves navigation, makes information easier to find, and presents your content in a logical way. Search engines also crawl and index well-structured websites more effectively, which improves visibility and attracts more visitors.

Ultimately, a thoughtfully built structure enhances user experience and boosts conversion rates.

### Your website includes _Services_, _About_, and _Testimonials_ pages

Dedicated pages for core sections like _Services_, _About Me_, and _Testimonials_ improve site navigation and overall usability.

On the _Services_ page, describe your offerings in detail.

On the _Testimonials_ page, regularly publish client feedback. Each testimonial is a piece of unique content that might include relevant keywords and help with SEO.

These informative pages help search engines better understand and index your content and increase your site’s relevance for key search queries.

### Your region is mentioned on _Services_ and _Contact_ pages

It’s important to include your city or region on the _Services_ and _Contact_ pages. For example, clients in Paris aren’t just searching for _a photographer_—they’re looking for a _**family photographer in Paris**_, a _**real estate photographer in Paris**_, etc.

Mentioning your working region is critical for improving your visibility in local search results. It signals to search engines where you provide services and helps improve your ranking for regional queries.

### Page headings include keywords

Use keywords in your page headings and subheadings (H1, H2, etc.)—they play an important role in SEO. Headings should be informative and include the main search terms you want the page to rank for.

For example, instead of writing just _**Pricing**_, use _**Photo session pricing**_. Instead of _**Photography services**_, go with _**Photography services in Singapore**_.

This helps both users and search engines quickly understand what your page is about and ensures it matches specific search intents.

### Text is divided into paragraphs with subheadings

A clear content structure benefits both users and search engines. Break the text into logical blocks using headings and subheadings. This improves readability and allows users to scan and navigate the page with ease—while also helping search engines index your content more accurately.

### Pages are free of grammar and spelling errors

Well-written content without grammar or punctuation mistakes builds user trust and strengthens your site’s credibility. It’s important for both human visitors and search engines. Sites with poor grammar are less likely to rank well in search results.
