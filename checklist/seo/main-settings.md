# SEO: Site settings

Correct website settings ensure that your site is displayed properly in search engines, improve its visibility, and build trust with users. These settings are critical for attracting visitors and achieving your business goals.

### Website title (title tag) is filled in correctly

The website title is one of the most important SEO elements. It should be unique, concise, and include the main search query that users would use to find you. This helps search engines understand what your site is about and encourages users to click on your link.

For example, if your site is about wedding photography and you're based in Moscow, the title might be:

> Wedding photographer in New York Paula Munoz

Be sure to mention your genre (e.g., wedding photography), your location, and your name—this helps you build a personal brand.

### Website description (meta description) is filled in correctly

The meta description is a short text that appears below the page title in search results. It should complement the title, be informative, and include relevant keywords for your field. A well-written description attracts users and gives them a clear idea of what your site is about. The ideal length is 200–250 characters.

For example:

> Paula Munoz is an experienced wedding photographer in New York. Capture the most memorable moments of your special day with professional and creative photography at affordable prices. Book your session and browse my portfolio on the website.

### Your service region is mentioned in the footer text

Mentioning your city or region in the footer helps with local SEO. It tells search engines where your services are offered and increases your chances of appearing in local search results. Be sure to include your location in the footer of your website.
