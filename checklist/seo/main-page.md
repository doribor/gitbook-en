# SEO: Main page

Optimizing your homepage for search engines is one of the key factors that contributes to your website’s success. Below are the essential steps to follow.

### An H1 heading includes your name and working region

The first heading on your homepage is one of the most important SEO elements. It should be unique, include a potential search query people might use to find you, and grab the attention of visitors.

A well-written H1 not only improves SEO but also increases the chances that people will click through to your site.

### Unique text (1000–1500 characters)

Having 1000–1500 characters of unique text on your homepage plays a crucial role in SEO. This text should be informative, relevant, and include keywords you want to be found for, along with your name and location.

For example, if you’re a wedding photographer in New York, your keywords might include: _photographer_, _wedding_, _book_, _price_, _New York_.

Avoid overstuffing the text with keywords — this can lead to search engine penalties for over-optimization. Your content should sound natural. Quality content is the foundation of a successful website.

### Text is divided into paragraphs with subheadings

The structure of your content matters for both users and search engines. Break your text into logical sections using headings and subheadings. This improves readability and helps search engines better understand your content.

A clear structure also enhances the user experience, which contributes to better SEO performance.
