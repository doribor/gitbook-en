# Login system update: now password-free

Previously, during registration, you could create a password, but logging in always required additional verification—a one-time access code sent via email. While this enhanced account security, it also made the login process more complex.

Now, **passwords are no longer required**—you only need the access code sent to your email. This makes authentication simpler and more user-friendly.

#### **Where to receive the code?**

The **access code** is sent to the email address specified in the **Profile** section of your settings.

For more details on access codes and logging in, check out the article: [login.md](login.md "mention").
