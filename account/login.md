#### Frequently Asked Questions

* **Why was the password removed?**\
  Previously, logging in with a password still required an additional access code as a mandatory security measure. Now, the process is simpler: the code remains, but the password is no longer needed.
* **What if I don't receive the code?**
  * Check your **Spam** and **Promotions** folders.
  * Ensure there is **enough storage space** in your email account or on your device for new messages.
* **Can I disable the access code?**\
  No, the access code is a mandatory security feature.
* **Do I need to enter the code every time I log in?**\
  No, as long as you don’t manually log out by clicking Log out, you won't need to enter the code again.
