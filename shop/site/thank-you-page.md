# How to create Thank you page

A Thank You page allows you to express gratitude to customers for their interest in your services after they make a purchase or submit a request. You can also use it to provide additional information.

How to create and customize a Thank You page:

* Create a [**landing page**](../../site/pages/landing.md).
* Add a thank-you message. Include additional details, such as text, images, or videos.
* Link the page to a button: open the page with the **payment** or **request** button. Go to the **button settings**.
* Set the action to **Open website page** and select the Thank You page you created.
