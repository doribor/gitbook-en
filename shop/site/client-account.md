# How to create a personal account of the client

You can make pages that will be available to a limited number of users (like personal account of users). The list of users who will have access to the page, that you can make by yourself. This type of access can be granted for a limited and unlimited period.

Access to the page is provided by sending unique one-time passwords to the mail of users.

### How does a one-time password work?

When opening a page with one-time password, the user needs to enter the email for access. The password is sent only to the email address that is in the customer database for this page.

After that, you will have the **Clients** tab, where the database of clients who have been granted access to the page is stored. Here you can add new records and edit existing ones.

You can change the client's name, email, and also limit the period of access to the page in the client settings.

### How to add access to the personal account after purchasing the product

* Go to the Shop to [add a product card](../general/add-product.md).
* Navigate to the **Actions after the order** tab.
* Enable redirect to a **Website page** protected with one-time passwords. If necessary, limit access period.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the product card is set to redirect to a page with a **one-time password**, the buyer’s email will be automatically added to the client database after purchase.
{% endhint %}

You can add information available only to buyers, for example, video tutorials. Check the article:

{% content-ref url="../../site/content/protect-videos.md" %}
[protect-videos.md](../../site/content/protect-videos.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can also upload files of any other format to the page:

{% content-ref url="../../site/content/add-file.md" %}
[add-file.md](../../site/content/add-file.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
