# Add product card

You can sell products and services directly on your website by setting up payment options and an order form. It can be a physical item, a digital product, a consultation, a photoshoot request, etc.

### How to create a product card <a href="#add" id="add"></a>

* Go to the **Shop** and click on the **Add product**.
* Enter the product or service name and description, and upload images.

* Select **payment method**:

1. **Online payment.** If you want to accept payments directly on the website. Don’t forget to connect a [payment system](../../payments/systems.md).
2. **Cash payment.** A client will place an order, and you will contact them directly.

* Set the price for the product or service. You can also add multiple pricing options: see [#variations](add-product.md#variations "mention") below.
* Enable the **Allow quantity selection** toggle if you want customers to order more than one item at a time.
* Click **Add** to save the product.
* If needed, configure contact collection or post-order actions as explained below.

#### Where can a product or a service be displayed?

✔ [On a page of your website](../site/products.md).\
✔ [In a gallery on the Drive](../gallery/products.md).\
✔ You can also share a direct link to the product page.
{% endhint %}

### Price variations for a product <a href="#variations" id="variations"></a>

Go to the **Price per variations** to set different prices depending on the version of the product or service.\
This could include different print sizes, service packages, etc.

You can add up to 7 variants.

### How to set up the order form <a href="#form" id="form"></a>

The order form lets you collect necessary information from the customer.\
By default, it asks for the customer’s name (and email for online payments).

To collect more details, go to the **Order form settings** tab and add extra fields:

* **Phone number.**
* **Short text field**—for brief answers (e.g. client’s social media profile).
* **Dropdown list**—if the client needs to choose from options.
* **Comment**—for a detailed message from the client.

**Example:** When placing an order, the customer provides their social media link, selects an option, and enters a delivery address.

### How to set up post-order actions <a href="#actions" id="actions"></a>

✔ You can redirect the customer to a specific page or external link (e.g. to download or view something).\
✔ Or send a confirmation email with additional information.

To do this, go to the **After the order** tab in the product card.

#### Redirect to a page

Enable the **Go to page** toggle and set up one of the options:

* **Go to an external address.** Paste any link (e.g. to a file, private Telegram chat, another website).
* **Go to page.** Choose one of your existing pages (available on plans with the website builder).

#### Email after payment

Enable the **Send message** toggle and write the message that will be sent to the client after they make a purchase.

Use the text formatting toolbar to:\
**B** – bold, **I** – italic, **U** – underline, **S** – strikethrough, 🔗 – insert a link.
