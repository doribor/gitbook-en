# Payment system connection

To allow visitors to make payments on your website and for you to receive them, you need to connect one of the available payment systems and add goods or services for sale.



{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/payment-systems.md" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Wfolio does not accept or process payments directly but provides the connection to external services. Before connecting a payment service, review its fees and terms of service.
{% endhint %}
