# How to change the page address

The page address is the address where the page will be available on the Internet. The address can consist of Latin letters, numbers and symbols \_-.&#x20;

When working with a page in the control panel, the page address is generated automatically from its name. For example, a page titled **Family and Children** will have the address  `/family-and-children` . We do not recommend changing the page address manually without a good reason, because using the page name in the address helps search engines index the site and improves its Search Engines Ranking.&#x20;

How to do it step by step:&#x20;

* Open the page for editing and click on the **«Settings»** menu item.
* In the opened window in the **«Page address»** field, enter the new page address. Click on the **«Save»** button.
