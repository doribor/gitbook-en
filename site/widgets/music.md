# How to add music

You can add an audio file from an external service to the website.

To add music to a page, you need to insert the audio file code into an HTML block. Let's look at adding a player using the example of SoundCloud.

* Go to the [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) website and find the track.

* After finding the track, hover over the track and click on the **Share**. Select **Embed** and **copy the code**.

* Go to the Wfolio control panel in the **Site** section. Open the custom page to which you want to add the player and add a new block by clicking <mark style="background-color:blue;">**+**</mark>. In the window that opens, select the **Widgets** tab and at the bottom of the list, choose an appropriately sized HTML block.

* **Paste the copied code into the HTML block**. Save the changes.

Now, when viewing the page, a widget with a player and the ability to listen to the track will be displayed.

Automatic music playback will not work as all browsers block it. Music (and videos with sound) can only be played by a user's click.
