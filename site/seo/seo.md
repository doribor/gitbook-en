# How to get into Google search

You do not need to be a professional to promote your website. It is enough to optimize the site, share photoshoots via the cloud drive, and keep content fresh with regular updates.

### 1. Optimize your site's settings

Start by setting up your website's **title** and **description** in the **Site settings** section. These will appear in search engine results and on social media previews, so make them count.

The title must contain your name, profession, and the city or region where you work.

The description of the site is a brief introduction about you and what you do. It complements the title. Tell about your activity and region of work, about your styles and genres of shooting.

Be sure to avoid all caps or spelling errors—search engines may lower your ranking if they detect mistakes.

### 2. Write an engaging text for the home page

Filling out the title and description is important, but not enough. Texts on the pages of your site play an important role for search engines, and your home page text quality is crucial for both visitors and search engines.

Use this space to introduce yourself, outline your services, and mention the areas you cover. You can also share achievements or other important details.

To make your homepage content visually appealing, break it up into sections.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Headings in the texts play a significant role for promotion. Use headings that include relevant keywords for SEO.

Keep in mind that the first heading is the most important one.

### **3. Specify your location**

Search results for photography services vary by city, so make sure to list your **location** clearly. If you do not mention your city, your site may not appear in local searches.

Add the city or region where you work on key pages like **the homepage, Services, and Contact pages** to improve your local SEO.

Add the city or region of your wok in the footer: it is displayed on every page of your site.

### 4. Share photoshoots via the cloud drive

Galleries stored on your cloud drive are an elegant and convenient way to share photos and videos. It is also an effective tool for improving your site's search engine ranking. Since the cloud drive is hosted on your site's domain, its traffic is included in the overall site statistic.

{% hint style="info" %}
These steps will be enough to find your site in the search. If you want your site to be in high positions in the search results, then you need to create many thematic pages with texts and images.
{% endhint %}

### **5. Add t**hematic pages and keep content fresh

Site information does not immediately appear in the search, and the search results are not immediately updated. Search robots return to a site from time to time to update the information. Thus, regular updates are essential for SEO success. Search engines prioritize "alive" sites, so make sure your site is frequently updated with fresh content.

Post new galleries, behind-the-scenes shots, or blog entries. When you add new pages, do not forget to include relevant keywords. You can use sections like the **Blog** or **Shooting Previews** to showcase your latest work.

For example, sharing your photos via **Shooting previews** will allow you to:

* Share with clients the first photos on a gallery page when the whole photoshoot is not ready.
* Develop word-of-mouth marketing: clients can share photos and a link to your site on their social media.
* Promote your site in search engines automatically due to regular content updates.

{% endhint %}

Use keywords in the titles of previews for better optimization.

> For example, write not just _Jack_, but _**Jack's photo session**_, not just _Helen_, but _**Photo walk with Helen**_, not just _Marie_, but _**Marie. Business portrait**_, not just _Hope + Dean_, but _**Hope + Dean, the announcement of a wedding photoshoot**_ in the titles, and so on.

### What else can be done to improve the site ranking

1. **Maintain a customer feedback page.** Each review or testimonial is a piece of unique content that helps your site rank better.
2. **Promote your site on social media.** The more visits your site gets, the better your search engine rankings.
3. **Register your site in the directories of Google** to get free advertising. After checking the information, search engines will be able to show your site in additional services.
4. **Add your site to the Google search engine.** This can be done by using Google Search Console. Read the instructions here: [webmaster.md](webmaster.md "mention").

### How long will it take to get to the TOP?

Improving your site's ranking depends on several factors, including competitor activity and search engine algorithms. Generally, it can take around four months or longer to see significant progress. The more quality pages you add, the more search queries your site can rank for.
