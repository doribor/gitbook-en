# Alt-texts for images

Alt text is a short description of the image. This is a kind of metadata that is not displayed on the page, but is very important for three reasons:

1. Search engines use this text to understand what is depicted in the picture and give additional "weight" to your page in the search.
2. Images with alt text are indexed and participate in the Google.Images search.
3. People with visual disabilities use special browsers that instead of images reproduce their text description from the alt attribute.

### Filling rules

* **What to write about.** Focus on the main things depicted in the photo. Write in simple, understandable language, trying to tell your imaginary friend what is depicted in the photo.
* **The length of the text.** The recommended length of alt text is 7-9 words. The text should not be shorter than 3-5 words and longer 13-15 words.
* **No spam.** Don't use a lot of keywords in the alt text, it may be perceived by search engines as spam. It's better to come up with a good text and, if possible, include a couple of suitable keywords in it.
* **If there are a lot of photos.** There is no need to write many identical descriptions, it is enough to specify the alt text only for different photos.

**Examples of alt-texts:**

* The bride and groom jump near Bronze horseman on a clear sunny day.
* The bride and her children are walking along a dirt road in a green park with a bouquet of flowers.
* A large bouquet of red and white roses and a yellow minibus in the background. &#x20;
* A tall girl on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in a gray coat and with a large knitted scarf. Cloudy day, gray sandy beach, strong wind and waves.
* A young man in a white polo shirt and blue jeans is sitting on a gray sofa with yellow pillows.
* Portrait of a girl in a dark green shirt with brown hair, freckles and green eyes on a light gray background.
