# SEO page settings

You can customize the SEO of pages in the **Bulk editing** page.

The most important thing in this table is the **page titles**, they need to be given the most attention. Because search engines give page titles the highest priority. In the title of the pages, use various keywords as part of the title.

For example, for an album with photos, the name _Family New Year photo shoot_ is suitable, for the Services page, the name _Cost of a studio photo shoot_ or _Price of a family photo shoot_ is suitable.

To diversify the page titles, use the seasons, filming locations, weather, mood, and other shooting details.

For example:

* _Wedding photo shoot in London_
* _Thematic portrait photo shoot in France_
* _Winter photo walk_
* _Portrait photo shoot in the studio_
* _Photo shoot in the noir style_

Remember that all page names on your website must be unique and must not be repeated.

The important to know:

* Page titles and descriptions should not be repeated. It should be meaningful text, not a set of words, and should match to the content of the page.
* Use keywords in the page titles. Don't put a dot after the name. But do not forget to put a dot after the description.
* Page names are very important for search engines. If there are a lot of pages on your website and filling in all the settings causes difficulties, then you can leave the descriptions empty, but the page names must be filled in.
* And the most important thing. Filling in the search settings is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for successful promotion. Without text on the website, for example, descriptions of photo series, price packages, text about yourself — search settings will not give the maximum result. Read the article:
