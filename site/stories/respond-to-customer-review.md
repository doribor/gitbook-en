# How to respond to customer reviews

Sooner or later, you will have a lot of reviews on the site and you may want to respond to some of them. It will be difficult to write to each client individually, and the same type of answers will not look personalized.

We suggest to use the **Previes** section for this purpose. Post the first photos from the photo shoot, add a feedback from the client, your kind words about the client, photo shoot description. This will create a two-way communication that your client and all site visitors will see.

How to do this step by step:

* Go to the page settings.
* Attach the review, then click the **Save** button.

* Write a few words about the photo session and the client in the **Short description** field.

Thus, visitors can see the client’s feedback about the photo shoot and your response.
