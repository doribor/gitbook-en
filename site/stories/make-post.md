# How to make good posts

A **blog** is needed to write text posts and share useful information. This is a great way to promote your website. You can write unique text on your website, thereby improving search engine optimization.

**Stories** are a simple, beautiful and effective tool for transmitting the first best photos from the shooting. In Stories, you can also write text and share useful information, but the main purpose of them is to publish your best pictures from the series. How to promote a website in search engines through announcements, read the article [previews.md](previews.md "mention").

We will tell you about the recommendations that are needed to make a post look beautiful and the text is readable.

### The main rules for the design of the post

* Break the text into paragraphs.
* Create lists.
* Use subheadings.
* Highlight key thoughts in italics and/or bold.

Let's tell you more about how to do this:

#### Medium-width text blocks

This is the ideal width for a text block. Text with a larger width will be difficult to read and you will have less chance that the visitor will carefully read the entire text and will not leave the page.

#### Text formatting

It is important to format the text on the website. Specify the title of the text with the **Header** option and the text with the **Text** option. If you have an enumeration in the text, use **Unordered List** or **Numbered List**.

Select the text you need and select the formatting option in the panel at the top.

#### Text alignment

The ideal option is text alignment is on the **left edge**. It is the easiest for the user to read it. The exceptions are headings and subheadings.

We do not recommend using width alignment, since in this case there may be uneven spaces between words.

To align the text, select the paragraph you need and select the alignment option in the panel above.

#### Divide texts into paragraphs

Divide the text into logical blogs and alternate it with the image. So you will greatly simplify the task for the reader.
