# How to allow photo downloads on your website

By default, photos on your website **can’t be downloaded**—right-click saving is disabled.\
However, if you want to let visitors download a few of your best shots, you can enable this option.

Once enabled, a **Download** button will appear on your photos:

* **On desktop** the button appears when you hover over a photo.
* **On mobile** the button appears either under the image (in the **Images** block) or in fullscreen mode (in the **Gallery** block).

### 💡 Useful info

✔ Only **web-optimized versions** of images are downloaded (not the originals).\
✔ This feature only applies to blog and announcement posts on your website. For gallery downloads, see: [download.md](../../gallery/share/download.md "mention").
