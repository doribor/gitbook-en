# Blog

Blog helps make your website feel alive and engaging for your clients.

With a blog, you can:

* **Attract new clients**. People can discover you through blog posts in search engines. It’s another way to showcase your work.
* **Improve SEO**. Websites that regularly add new pages (like blog posts) tend to rank higher in search results.
* **Connect with your audience**. When visitors read your posts, they get a better sense of your style, values, and approach to work. This builds trust and helps them choose you.
* **Share your experience**. Use the blog to talk about photo shoots, share personal insights or funny stories, and show the atmosphere behind your work.

### What you can publish in your blog

* Reports from recent shoots.
* Tips for preparing for a photo session.
* Stories from your practice.
* Client reviews.
* News about your work or projects.

### How to add a blog to your site

* Add a **Blog** page to your website—all your posts will appear there.
* Click on the **Add post**.
* Give your post a title and upload a **thumbnail image**—it will be displayed on the post list page.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don’t upload a thumbnail, the post will remain unpublished.
{% endhint %}
