# Stories

The **Stories** section is a simple, beautiful and effective tool for sharing the first best photos from the photo shooting.

Sharing photos through the Stories will allow you to:

* Share photos with clients in a beautiful way.
* Develop word-of-mouth marketing.
* Promote your site in search engines automatically.

### How to use it

1. **Upload** the first set of photos that you need to share with the client a few days after the photo shooting.
2. **Write** a couple of lines about your client.
3. **Send** the client a link to the website page so that he can visit it to download the photos.

{% hint style="success" %}
Use the Stories section not as a faceless file sharing service, but as a privilege for your clients. Make the client feel special. Thereby the client will be happy to share the link to his photos with his friends.
{% endhint %}

If the photo shooting is confidential, then you can **make the story hidden** (it will be available for viewing only via a direct link).

Share photos with clients beautifully and grow your business.

### How it works

As a result of sharing photos through the Stories, you get word-of-mouth marketing and search engine promotion.

* **How does word of mouth marketing work?** A client comes to your site to download photos. He sends a link to friends and other participants in the photo shooting, who see not only these photos, but also your portfolio, services, contacts and links to social networks.
* **How does search engine promotion work?** As a result of increased traffic and the usage of titles and descriptions in announcements, your site will be automatically promoted in search engines.

{% hint style="success" %}
It **gives an explosive growth in site traffic** after family, reportage, wedding or other group photo shootings.
{% endhint %}

### 💡 Useful tip

Use keywords in stories titles for promotion. Give your story a name AND context:

* Not _Maria_ but _Maria’s photo session_.
* Not _Eve_ but _Photo walk with Eve_.
* Not just _Carl_ but _Carl. Business portrait_.
* Not _Daisy + John_ but _Daisy + John, the announcement of a wedding photoshoot_.
* And so on!
