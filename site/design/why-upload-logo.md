# Why do I need a logotype for a website

The logotype is an important element that will improve your awareness among customers and website visitors.

### Why is the logotype important?

1. **Attracting attention.** The visitor has a few seconds to decide whether your services deserve his attention. This short glance of the visitor can work for your benefit if you have a high-quality and memorable logotype.
2. **Your personality.** Colors, tones, fonts — all this determines the identity of you and your brand.
3. **A memorable element.** Most of your audience, who will remember the company name, will associate the name with your logo.
4. **Stand out from competitors.** Don't be afraid to be different from others. A logo is a way to express your values and demonstrate to visitors why you are better than your competitors.

You can create a logotype according to the instructions 📖 **Creating and uploading a logo.**

{% content-ref url="upload-logo.md" %}
[upload-logo.md](upload-logo.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can remove the website logo by following the instructions 📖 **How to remove the logo**.

{% content-ref url="delete-logo.md" %}
[delete-logo.md](delete-logo.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
