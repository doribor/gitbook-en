# Site theme

The site theme can be changed at any time and any number of times, and all the content will be saved. The design settings of the current theme will also be saved and activated when you choose that theme again.



### How to change the theme

This article is about the **website theme**—designer-selected styles for your site with predefined element placement.\
To change the template of an individual page, see the guide: [change-page-template.md](../pages/change-page-template.md "mention")

To change the theme of the site, go to the **Design** section and click on the **Switch theme** button. Choose a new site theme in the opened window.
