# Dark theme

It is possible to set the **night mode** on different devices and browsers.\
You can enable it in the browser settings on Android or Windows devices and in the device's main settings on iOS devices.

### How it works

If **you have a light website background** and the website visitor turned on night mode, the background color on the visitor's screen will change **to dark and the text color to white**.

If **you have a dark website background**, and the website visitor turned on night mode, then he will see the website as dark.

You can enable and see how the night mode works on the **Design** page in the **Site colors** section.
