# How to make an announcement bar

With the help of the informer, you can make an announcement of a promotion or a seasonal offer. It will be displayed on all pages of the site until the visitor follows the link or hides it.

Go to the **Site settings** page → **Informer settings** section and enable the informer.

Here you can change the text and color of the announcement bar, as well as select the page that the viewer will be redirected to. **Save your changes.**

As the result, an advertising link will be displayed at the top of your website that will redirect your client to the page you need.
