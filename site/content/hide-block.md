# How to hide blocks

Sometimes, you may need a specific block on your website to be visible only on desktop, only on mobile, or completely hidden.

By default, all blocks are visible on **all devices**. You can change this in the block settings.



1. Open the **settings** of the desired block.
2. Find the **Show on devices** option and select one of the following:

* **All Devices**. The block will be visible on both desktop and mobile (default setting).
* **Desktop only**. The block will appear only in the full site version.
* **Mobile only**. The block will be visible only on mobile devices.
* **Hide**. The block will not appear on the site but will remain in the admin panel.
