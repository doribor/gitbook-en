# How to add buttons to social networks

You can add beautiful buttons with icons of social networks and messengers to your page so that visitors can follow you on social networks or contact you.

On a custom page, click the **+** button to add a new block. In the window that opens, choose the **Buttons** tab and select the block option with a button that suits you.

* Go to the button settings.
* In the button settings, select the action **Go to social network** (to add Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Vimeo) or **Go to messenger** (to add WhatsApp, Telegram). From the dropdown list, choose a social network or messenger and enter the URL of your profile or your phone number.
