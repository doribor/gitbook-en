# Photo captions

You can add captions to photos on a page to share context about the shoot, the location, the people in the photo, or any other relevant details.

### Where captions can be added

Captions are available in the following blocks:

* Gallery block and [albums](../portfolio/add-albums-galleries.md). Captions appear:
  * On hover (desktop view).
  * In full-screen mode (mobile view).
* [Slider](slider.md) block. The caption is shown directly on the photo.

### How to add captions to photos

* Open the desired page in the admin panel.
* Go to the **Alt texts** tab.
* In the table that opens, fill in the **Description** column—this text will be shown on the website.

The second column is for the [alt text](../seo/alt-text.md), which is used by search engines but not displayed on the page.\
If you only want to display a caption, just fill in the first column.

{% hint style="info" %}
Captions for single photos (outside of galleries or sliders) are not yet available—this feature is coming soon. You’ll see a greyed-out area next to those photos instead of a text field.

### Tips for writing captions

✔ Keep it short — 1-2 lines is usually enough.\
✔ Use captions to highlight the idea behind the shot or convey the mood.
