# How to protect videos from downloading

To protect videos on your website from downloading, it's best to upload them to specialized video hosting platforms that offer strong protection against video downloads through DRM encryption. Although many hosting options exist, platforms like YouTube don't provide download protection since there are numerous plugins that allow downloading or accessing content.

#### What is DRM Encryption?

**DRM (Digital Rights Management) encryption** is a digital content protection technology that restricts video playback to authorized users who have special decryption keys. This prevents unauthorized copying and use of content, even if the file has been downloaded: without these keys, the video will either not open or will be unplayable.
