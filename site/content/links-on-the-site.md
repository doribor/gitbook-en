# Links on the site

You can add a link to text, an image, or a button so visitors can navigate to other pages on your website or to external sites.\
You can also link to an external address from the menu or create an **anchor link** for quick navigation to a specific section of a page.

### Adding a link to text

* Open the page and highlight the text you want to turn into a link.
* In the toolbar that appears, click on the **Link** icon.
* Paste the link to a page on your website or any other address (e.g., `https://portfolioaward.com`).
* Save your changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Links to your own site open in the same tab, while links to other sites open in a new browser tab.

If you have registered and paid for a domain (e.g., in the `.com` zone), you can configure a link to a page on your site to open in a new tab. To do this, add `www` to the link address. For example, [https://www.doribor.com/blog](https://doribor.com/en/blog).

You can add a link to images on a composite page (in **Image** blocks).

* Open the page and click on the image.
* In the toolbar, click on the **Link**.

* Set the action:
  * **Open website page** adds a link to another page on your site.
  * **Go to external address** adds a link to another website.
  * Or choose another action. For example, call a phone number, link to social media/messengers, or open a store product.

### Adding a link in the menu

By default, the menu shows links to pages on your site.\
However, you can also add a link to another website or a phone number.

* Click on the **Add to site** and select **Link**.
* Give the link a name (this will appear in the menu) and enable **Show in menu**.
* To add a phone number to the menu, choose **Make a call** as the action and enter the phone number.

### Anchor links (jump to a specific block on a page)

Each block on your website has a unique ID (anchor) that can be used to jump directly to it.

* Open the composite page and go to the **block settings**.
* In the settings window, find the anchor link (it starts with `#section`) and click on it to copy.

* Add this anchor link to text, an image, or a button. Or insert it into the menu as described above.
* Save your changes.

When a visitor clicks an anchor link, they’ll be taken directly to the specified block on the page.
