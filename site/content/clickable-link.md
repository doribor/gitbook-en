# How to make a clickable link

You can make a clickable link so that when a visitor clicks on a text or picture, he will go from one page of your site to another or to an external site.

{% hint style="info" %}
Links to external websites (e.g., the address `https://wfolio.com`) open in a new browser tab. Links pointing to internal pages of your site open in the current browser tab.

If you have registered and paid for a domain (e.g., in the `.com` zone), you can configure a link to a page on your site to open in a new tab. To do this, add `www` to the link address. For example, [https://www.doribor.com/blog](https://doribor.com/en/blog).
{% endhint %}

### Button link

On a [custom page](../edit-page/add-custom-page.md), click the <mark style="background-color:blue;">**+**</mark> button to add a new block. In the window that appears, open the **Buttons** tab and select the block option with a button that suits you.

#### Site page link

In the button settings, select **Open website page** and specify the page to which the transition will be made.

#### Redirect to an external address

Using the button, you can set up a redirect to an external address. For example, you can [add a download link](add-file.md) or a link to your blog or magazine publications.

In the button settings, select **Go to external address** and insert the link address.

#### Buttons for social networks and messengers

You can add stylish buttons with icons of social networks and messengers to your website pages, allowing visitors to go to your social media profiles or contact you.

In the button settings, select the action **Go to social network** (to add Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Vimeo) or **Go to messenger** (to add WhatsApp, Telegram). From the dropdown list, choose a social network or messenger and enter the URL of your profile or your phone number.

{% hint style="info" %}
For WhatsApp, you can additionally set up an automatic message.
{% endhint %}

#### Phone number

In the button settings, select **Make a phone call** and enter the phone number.

#### Email

In the button settings, select **Go to external address** and insert the `mailto:youremail`, where youremail is your email address.

#### Form submissions and payment processing
