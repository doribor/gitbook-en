# What files can be uploaded to the site

### Uploading photos

Upload high-resolution photos—the site will automatically resize them for different devices **without losing quality**. You can upload files in the next formats:

✔ **JPEG**. Recommended size: at least **2560px on the long side**.\
✔ **PNG**. Up to **20 MB**. If the file is larger, compress it using [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com).

#### Color profile

Make sure your images use the **sRGB color profile**. This ensures correct color rendering after uploading to the website.
{% endhint %}

### Uploading videos

You can upload videos to [banners](add-banner.md), [page covers](../pages/page-cover.md), and Gallery blocks:

✔ Size up to **300 MB**.\
✔ Format **MP4** or **MOV**.\
✔ Codec **h.264 (AVC) or h.265 (HEVC)**.

You can also add videos from other services (YouTube, Vimeo, Kinescope) via a link. Learn more about it here: [add-video.md](add-video.md "mention").

#### Photo downloads on the website

In **announcement** or **blog** posts, you can enable photo downloads when creating or editing a post: [download-photos.md](../stories/download-photos.md "mention"). Use these sections to share a few highlights from the shoot.

{% hint style="success" %}
Photos on other website pages **cannot be downloaded**. To deliver full galleries, use the **cloud drive**.
{% endhint %}

#### File downloads on the website

You can upload a file (e.g., a **PDF**) to the cloud drive and generate a download link.\
Add this link to your website—visitors will be able to download the file directly to their device.\
Learn more: [add-file.md](add-file.md "mention").
