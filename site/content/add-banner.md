# Banner block

Banner block is a full-width visual element used to draw attention to your content or divide sections of information.&#x20;

You can create a banner with one or more images, as well as a video banner with auto-playback.

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Photo and video requirements

**Photos:**

✔ Size – at least 2560×1920px. Most screens have aspect ratios close to 16:9, while mobile phones are close to 21:9. We recommend to choose photos close to this format&#x20;

**Videos:**

✔ Size — up to 300 MB.\
✔ Format — MP4 or MOV.\
✔ Codec — h.264/AVC or h.265/HEVC.
{% endhint %}

### Adding an image banner and a slider banner

{% hint style="info" %}

Set up banner height. An image or a video will get cropped at the top and bottom.

{% hint style="info" %}
Height settings will be applied to the full version of your website. In the mobile version the height will have a fixed height. This difference has to do with the screen types: wide for PC and laptops and narrow for mobile devices.
{% endhint %}

### Parallax

The parallax effect can be enabled for **the Image banner**. The image will move as you scroll the page.

To do this, upload the image to the block and activate the **Parallax switch**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The parallax effect is available for all the site themes except Deka and Plain.

It shows up on the computers. We will add parallax effect for mobile devices in the future updates.
