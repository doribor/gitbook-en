# How to translate a website

### How it works

When users visit your website, it opens in the default language. For versions of the site in other languages, a language prefix is added to the URL. For example, if your website's address in English is `https://site.com`, the Spanish version would be `https://site.com/es`.

When a second language is enabled, system messages (e.g., _Page not found_) and system buttons (e.g., _Leave feedback_) are automatically translated. However, any custom text you've added will need to be translated manually.

### How to add multiple languages

To enable multiple languages for the website, send a request to the support team. After your request is processed, you will be able to add new languages for your site.

* Go to the **Multilanguage** page in the **Settings**. Click on the **Add language** button.
* Choose other languages.
* Translate the name and description of the site in the **Site settings**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Translate the name and description of the site **as soon as possible**, as they affect the website search promotion.
{% endhint %}

* Go to the **Site** section. The abbreviation indicates the current language. Click on it to switch between languages.

* In the second language mode, translate the page titles in the menu. Click on the **(⋮)** next to a page name and select **Settings**.

* Translate the text on the pages. Pay attention to the texts in forms and products if you have them.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you decide to add multilple languages to the website, translate all pages. If you leave the pages untranslated (in one language), then search engines will see them as duplicates, which will negatively affect search promotion.
{% endhint %}

As a result, you will have a website in two or more languages.



### Frequently asked questions

* **How can I hide a language version of the site while I’m working on translations?**\
  Currently, this is not possible. A newly added language version becomes immediately available to visitors.\
  If your site contains a lot of text, prepare translations in advance before enabling multilingual mode.
* **Can I disable certain sections of the site in one language version? For example, I have a blog in Finnish, but I don’t want to translate it into English.**\
  A multilingual website displays all pages in all connected languages for which translations are provided.\
  It’s not possible to remove content from one version while keeping it in another.\
  If you need the pages on different language versions to be different, you can create a second website on the platform: [multiple-sites.md](../../billing/multiple-sites.md "mention")
* **Can I add images and videos in Finnish for one language version, and in English for another?**\
  Page content (images, videos) does not change depending on the language version — only the text is translated.\
  If you want the page content to be different, you can create a second website on the platform: [multiple-sites.md](../../billing/multiple-sites.md "mention")
* **How do I create an anchor link on a multilingual website?**\
  On multilingual sites, anchor links can work within a single page. This ensures the link scrolls to the correct block in the correct language.\
  To create such a link, copy the anchor link from the main language version of the site and remove everything before `#section`. [#anchor-links-jump-to-a-specific-block-on-a-page](../content/links-on-the-site.md#anchor-links-jump-to-a-specific-block-on-a-page "mention")
