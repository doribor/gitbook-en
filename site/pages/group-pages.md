# How to group hidden pages

If your website has many hidden pages that you don’t work with regularly, you can organize them in one place using a **Blog** page.

### How to do it

* Go to the **Pages** section.
* Click on the **Add to site** and select the **Blog** page type.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to group [albums](../portfolio/add-albums-galleries.md), add a **Gallery** page instead of a Blog.

Currently, **you cannot group landing pages**.
{% endhint %}

* Give the page a name, for example, **Hidden pages**.
* Disable the **Show in menu** option and the page.

The blog is now created! Let’s add hidden pages to it:

* Return to the **Pages** section.
* Find the page you want to move. Click on the three dots **(⋮)** and select **Move page**.
* Choose the blog (or gallery) you created and move the page there.
