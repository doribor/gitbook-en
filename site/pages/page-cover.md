description: How to add a cover or slider to a page

# Page cover

You can add a photo or video cover to any page of your website. It can be a single image, a single video, or a slider with multiple images. You can overlay text, a button, and navigation arrows to switch between images.

These covers can be added in any [website theme](../design/change-theme.md) except for the **Plain** theme.

#### Recommended cover format

Most monitors have an aspect ratio close to **16:9**, while mobile phones are closer to **9:21**.\
Choose images with a similar aspect ratio, at least **2560px wide** and **1920px high**.\
There are no strict proportions—the cover automatically adapts to the user’s screen.
{% endhint %}

### Photo cover

* Open the page in the admin panel and go to the **Cover** tab.
* Upload your images.

#### How to set different covers for desktop and mobile

You can choose to display certain images only on desktop or only on mobile. To hide an image, click the device icon:

* 🖥️ **Hide in desktop version**—the image will only be visible on mobile.
* 📱 **Hide in mobile version**—the image will only be visible on desktop.

If you select both icons, the image will remain in the cover settings but won’t be visible on the page.

Currently, this option is available only for cover with images.

### Video cover

* Go to the page editor and select **Cover**.
* Choose **Video** as the cover type and click **Upload video**.
