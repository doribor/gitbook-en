# Password for a page

To protect the site page, you can set a password. Site users will be able to view the page only after entering the password you have set.

How to do it step by step:

* Go to the page settings and select the **Access** tab.

### How to set up email-based access to a page

You can grant access to a page only to specific clients by enabling login via email and a one-time password.

This is useful when providing materials (courses, presets, etc.) that are available after payment. Learn more here: [client-account.md](../../shop/site/client-account.md "mention")
