### How to set a page as the homepage

The homepage is the first page visitors see when they open your website. You can set any page as the homepage:

* In the **Site** section, click the three dots **(⋮)** next to the desired page and select **Set as homepage**.
* Or, when editing a page, click **Actions → Set as homepage**.

### How to move a page

You can move a page to a dropdown menu or a gallery. Custom pages can also be moved to the blog or announcements.

* In the **Site** section, click on the three dots **(⋮)** next to the desired page and select **Move page**.
* Or, when editing a page, click **Actions → Move page**.

Select the new location and confirm the move.

### How to hide a page

A hidden page does not appear in the website menu and is accessible only via a direct link.\
There are several ways to hide a page, album, or dropdown menu:

* In the **Site** section, disable the **Show in menu** toggle for the pages you want to hide.
* Or, when editing a page, turn off the **In menu** toggle at the top of the page.

You can allow or block search engines from indexing hidden pages in **Settings → Website settings**. See more here: [indexing.md](../seo/indexing.md "mention")

### How to copy a page

You can copy custom pages and blog (announcement) posts.

* In the **Site** section, click the three dots **(⋮)** next to the page and select **Copy page**.
* Or, when editing a page, click **Actions → Copy page**.

### How to rename a page

To change the page name:

* In the **Site** section, click the three dots **(⋮)** next to the page and go to **Settings**.
* Or, when editing the page, click **Actions → Settings**.

Enter the new name in the **Title** field and save your changes.

### How to change a page’s address (URL)

The page address is generated automatically based on its name. For example, a page named _Family and children_ will have the address `/family-and-children`.

To change the address:

* In the **Site** section, click the three dots **(⋮)** next to the page and go to **Settings**.
* Or, when editing the page, click **Actions → Settings**.

Enter the new address and save the changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the page is already indexed in search, set up a redirect to the new address in the S**ettings → Adding redirect rules**.\
If you don’t, the page with the old address will disappear from search results.
{% endhint %}

#### Bulk editing addresses

If you need to change the addresses for multiple pages at once, use the **Bulk editing** tool in settings.\
Changes are saved automatically.

### How to restore a page

A deleted page can be restored within **30 days**.

In the **Site** section, click **Deleted pages** and choose the page you want to restore from the list.
