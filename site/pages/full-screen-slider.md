### How to set it up

* In the **Site** section, click on the **Add to site** and select **Splash page**.
* In the pop-up window, enter the page name and click on the **Add**.
* Upload your photos or video.

For photos, you can choose to display them on **desktop** or **mobile** versions of the site. Use the icons above each image:

* Select horizontal images for desktop.
* Select vertical images for mobile.

Customize the page appearance. You can darken the background, add a title, caption, or button. Adjust slider display for mobile. Choose between **2:3 screen mode** or **keeping original proportions**.

If you select **keeping proportions**, make sure all cover photos have the same format. This ensures smooth and natural transitions between images.
