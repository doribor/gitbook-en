# FAQ: Website creation

* **I’m not a photographer or videographer. Can I create a website on your platform?**\
  Absolutely! Our themes and page templates are versatile and work for many types of professionals.\
  Just choose a layout that fits your needs and insert your own text and images.
* **How can I add or change social media icons?**\
  Go to **Design → Social media** to add or edit social icons.\
  More here: [social-media.md](../design/social-media.md "mention")

### Video on the website

* **Can I create a videographer portfolio?**\
  Yes! You can showcase videos in blocks or albums.\
  Add videos using links or upload them directly from your device for certain blocks. More details: [add-video.md](../content/add-video.md "mention")
* **Can I upload a video directly from my device instead of using a link?**\
  Yes! You can upload videos up to 100 MB in page covers, videos up to 300 MB in video banners, the Gallery and the Photo and Video blocks.

### Image requirements

* **What image formats can I upload to the website?**\
  Upload **JPEG** files (at least **2560px** on the long side) and **PNG** files up to **20 MB**.\
  To reduce PNG file size, use: [https://tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com)
* **Logo size**\
  Upload a logo with a height of at least **1600px**.
* **Recommended cover size for social media previews**\
  At least **1200px** in width.
* **Photo color profile**\
  Use the **sRGB** color profile.\
  If colors change after uploading, check the photo’s color profile.\
  For accurate display, photos must be in **sRGB**.

### Design and layout

* **Can I change the theme on my site?**\
  Yes, and all your page content will remain intact. You’ll just need to reapply your color and font settings.\
  More info: [change-theme.md](../design/change-theme.md "mention")
* **I disabled the logo, but it still shows up on mobile. Why?**\
  You can show or hide the logo **separately** for desktop and mobile versions of your site.
* **How do I change the layout/template of a page?**\
  Create a new page and select a different template.\
  More info: [change-page-template.md](change-page-template.md "mention")
* **How can I add blocks to an album?**\
  Convert the album into a **custom page** (note: this action is irreversible), then add any blocks you like.\
  More info: [add-blocks-to-album.md](../content/add-blocks-to-album.md "mention")
* **How can I add a screenshot of a review to my site?**\
  We don’t recommend adding screenshots of reviews.\
  Text reviews are better for SEO, since search engines can read them—but **not** text inside images.\
  You can use the **Reviews** page to post client reviews with text, avatar, social media link, and a link to their photo session.
* **Can I add a date to a review?**\
  Yes, you can include the date in the **text** of the review.\
  Dates are not shown automatically, so your reviews always look fresh.
* **How can I increase the number of fields in the contact form?**\
  You can use a custom form in the Shop. For this, create a product card in the Shop. Set payment method to **Request (price not specified)**. You’ll be able to collect contacts (email, phone, social link), use a dropdown menu, and request comments. Look for more information here: [request.md](../../shop/general/request.md "mention").\
  Or embed a form from an external service: [form.md](../widgets/form.md "mention")
* **What is the gear icon in the top left corner?**\
  You’ll see it when viewing your site in **Preview** mode.\
  Click on it to quickly return to the admin panel and edit the current page.
