# Custom page and blocks

A composite page is a custom page that can contain text, images, videos, forms, widgets, and more.\
You can create it from a ready-made template or build it yourself using blocks.

Examples of composite pages:

* _About me_ page.
* Contact information with a feedback form.
* Service pricing page.

Text-based pages with unique content have a positive effect on your website’s search engine ranking.
