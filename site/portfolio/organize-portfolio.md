# How to organize portfolio on a website

There are several ways to structure a portfolio on a website. Let's take a closer look at each option.

### Album with photos

**A photo album** is the easiest way to create a portfolio. The album will contain all your best works without splitting into different folders.

How to create this structure:

* In the **Site** section, click the **Add to site** button and select an **Album**. Give a name to the page, e.g., _Portfolio_. And add it to the site.

You can add text at the top and bottom of the album. But if you need to add additional blocks to the album, you can do it according to the instructions:

{% content-ref url="add-albums-galleries.md" %}
[add-albums-galleries.md](add-albums-galleries.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Gallery with albums

**An album gallery** is a page that contains several albums with photos. This method is suitable for you if you have several types of shooting and you need to separate them into different folders.

How to make this structure:

* In the **Site** section click the **Add to site** button and select a **Gallery**. Write the name of the page, for example, Portfolio. And click the Add button.

* After creating the gallery, click on the **Add an album** button. Name the album and upload your photos.
* Click **Add** button to add more albums and text at the beginning or at the end.

We have considered the first simple options for creating a portfolio on the website.&#x20;

You can create a portfolio with a more complex structure.

### Subsections in the portfolio

**The subsections in the portfolio** is a drop-down list with album galleries:

{% content-ref url="drop-down-menu.md" %}
[drop-down-menu.md](drop-down-menu.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Subpages

{% content-ref url="page-links.md" %}
[page-links.md](page-links.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
