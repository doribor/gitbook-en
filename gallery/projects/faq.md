# FAQ: Galleries

### What are the galleries for?

Galleries turn the delivery of shoots into a stylish and convenient process. Instead of faceless file-sharing services, you get a beautiful gallery where clients can easily view, download, and share photos. Galleries automate photo proofing, simplify additional sales and review collection. Built-in contact details help boost word-of-mouth marketing and increase traffic to your website.

### **Photo protection**

Galleries are accessible only via a unique direct link and are hidden from search engines due to indexing protection. You can also set a password for viewing the gallery and apply a watermark to the photos.

* **Where to upload a watermark?**\
  You can upload and configure a watermark in the **Other Settings** section (for Drive Only plans) or the **Drive Settings** (for Website + Drive plans).
* **Can screenshots be disabled?**\
  Gallery viewing happens via a link in the browser. Browsers do not allow disabling the screenshot function.
* **Why are characters added to the link address?**\
  By default, link brute-force protection is enabled for galleries: characters are added to the gallery’s URL (e.g., `-74h42v`). You can disable this in the drive settings if needed.

### Uploading & moving files, preview display

* **What files can be uploaded?**\
  Photos, videos, and any other file types are supported.
* **What color profile should photos use?**\
  sRGB — this is essential for proper photo display after upload.
* **My PNG thumbnails aren’t displaying. Why?**\
  PNG thumbnails display for images up to 10 MB. Reduce the file size or convert it to JPEG. Use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) for compression.
* **My RAW thumbnails aren’t displaying. Why?**\
  The drive shows thumbnails for JPEG files (up to 100 MB or 128 MP) and PNG files (up to 20 MB).\
  We will add the support of RAW files in the future updates.
* **What’s the maximum file size for upload?**\
  25 GB.
* **Can I create multiple folders in a gallery?**\
  Yes, you can. Check out an example of a gallery with multiple folders.
* **My iPhone photos lose quality when uploaded. What should I do?**\
  Upload your photos _as files_, not as images. Move them from **Gallery** to **Files** on your phone, then upload them from **Files** to the drive.
* **File names change when uploaded from iPhone. What can I do?**\
  To prevent renaming and compression, save photos to **Files** before uploading. Upload photos to your projects from **Files**, not directly from the photo gallery.
* **How to sort files in a project?**\
  You can sort by name, creation date, EXIF date, or by the number of selected/downloaded photos. Sort buttons are at the top and bottom of the project.
* **What’s the max number of files in a folder?**\
  Upload as many photos as needed. For easier viewing, split the shoot into folders.
* **Can I move files or folders between projects?**\
  Not yet. Files can only be moved within folders of the same project.

* **Are Galleries space limited?**\
  We offer plans with different capacities, including unlimited JPEG photo storage.\

  You can easily upgrade your plan in the admin panel.
* **How much storage is available for video?**\
  On unlimited, 240 GB Drive, and 1000 GB Drive plans, 120 GB is allocated for videos.

### Photo delivery & selection

* **How does photo selection work?**\
  Clients can create favorites lists for photobooks, retouching, or other tasks. Selected photos are shown in your admin panel.\
  See: [make-favorites-list.md](../selections/make-favorites-list.md "mention")
* **Can I limit the number of selected photos?**\
  Yes. Enable **Limit the number of photos for selection** in a project settings.
* **What if a client sees the message “You have already completed the selection”?**\
  This means the favorites list is marked as **Completed**. Change its status to **In Progress** to allow further selection.

### Design, cover & gallery appearance

* **Is there a mobile version of the client gallery?**\
  Yes. You can customize mobile appearance in the **Design and cove**r tab.
* **Can I add a project in another language?**\
  Yes. Choose a language in a project settings and translate the business card.
* **Can I link to another website in the gallery cover?**\
  The cover shows your website or business card address-- they are linked. You cannot set a different (e.g., Instagram) link as the cover link.\
  However, you can add other links in the project description.
* **My website is on another platform**—**can I link to it from the gallery?**\
  Yes! Connect the drive to a [subdomain](../../domain/subdomain.md) of your existing website.

### Notifications

* **Will I receive notifications about gallery activity?**\
  Yes, you’ll get email notifications about favorites list updates, gallery orders, and when projects are moved to the trash.
* **Can I disable notifications?**\
  Not currently. You can set up email rules to delete or archive notifications automatically.

  You can set an expiration date or keep it unlimited.\
  If the plan is blocked, projects go to trash after 7 days, then are permanently deleted after another 7 days.
* **What happens after project deletion?**\
  The project is moved to trash, and the gallery becomes inaccessible. After clicking on the link6 clients will see the message: _This link has expired_.\
  You have 7 days to recover it; afterward, it is permanently deleted.
* **What if there’s no Restore button next to my project?**\
  Unfortunately, the project has been deleted from our servers and cannot be recovered.

### Downloading files

* **Can I disable downloads?**\
  Yes. In project settings, disable **Enable downloading of originals**.

  Photos can be downloaded individually or as an archive. Unzip the archive to view.\
  On mobile, the archive will be saved to the **Files** app.
* **What’s the social media version?**\
