# Easy start

The **Cloud Drive** section is a built-in service for sharing photos with clients and business card with your contacts.

Are you also sharing photos through a file sharing service? Then don’t be surprised why word-of-mouth marketing doesn’t work for you.

Sharing files through the Cloud Drive on the site will allow you to:

* Make photo sharing beautiful.
* Develop word-of-mouth marketing.
* Receive customer feedback.

## How it works <a href="#how-it-works" id="how-it-works"></a>

The built-in drive on your site **is not a** **faceless file sharing service**, but a beautiful gallery for your clients. The drive contains all your contacts: phone, messengers, links to social networks and the site.

Just upload the photos and send the customer a link to view and download them.

{% hint style="success" %}
Clients will be happy to share the link with their friends.
{% endhint %}

This gives **an explosive increase** in attendance from family, reportage, wedding or other group shootings.

In addition, the use of the drive has a positive effect on the search engine promotion of your site, since it is at the address of your site and the drive traffic is summed up with the traffic on your site.

## Business card <a href="#business-card" id="business-card"></a>

[**Business card**](https://wfolio.com/my/card) - this is a multi-link page with your contacts where a client can contact you.&#x20;

The business card is displayed:&#x20;

* On the "Website + Drive" plan - at the domain address with the addition of "/me", for example, **mydomain.com/me**
* On the "Drive Only" plan - at your domain address, for example, **mydomain.com**

### Gallery examples <a href="#gallery-examples" id="gallery-examples"></a>

In most cases, real projects on the drive are not intended for public demonstration, so we have prepared examples of galleries on test drive for you: [examples.md](../examples.md "mention").
