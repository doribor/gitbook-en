# How to create a gallery template

A gallery template allows you to quickly create new galleries with a ready-made folder structure, descriptions, and links without having to set everything up from scratch.

### How to create a template

* Create a project on the cloud drive.
* Configure it:
  * Set up download options, favorites list settings, password protection, contacts—anything you usually use when delivering photos and want to copy.
  * Add the necessary folders, folder descriptions (available after uploading photos), and set links for each folder.
* In the project list, click on the **three dots (⋮)** next to the desired project.
* Select **Duplicate project**.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/duplicate gallery en.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When duplicating:

* All settings, folder structure, and folder links are preserved.
* Files inside folders are **not** copied.

### How to pin a template

You can pin up to **3 gallery templates**. To do this, in the project list, click the three dots **(⋮)** next to the desired project and select **Pin project**.

Pinned projects will always appear at the top of the list for quick access.
