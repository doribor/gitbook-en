# Folders and folder management

Break your shoot into parts using folders: sort files by locations, models, subjects, and more.

To do this, create a new project on the drive. Select folders on your device and drag them into the project, or create new folders in the project using the **Add folder** button.

The folder structure in the project will be preserved in the client gallery.

* **Copy link** – Share a link to this specific folder.
* **Download files** – Download all files from the folder to your device.

### Folder settings

You can set a name for each folder. This name is visible to your clients in the gallery and to you in the admin panel.

The folder’s URL appears after the gallery address and can include Latin letters, numbers, and hyphens (-).\
Example: `https://gallery.wfolio.pro/disk/workshop/backstage`.

The folder description is shown before the files at the top of the gallery. You can add it in the folder settings or by clicking **Add description**. Each folder can have its own unique description. The text can be formatted or turned into a link.
