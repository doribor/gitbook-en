# Hidden folders and guest access

Hidden folders are a useful tool when you want to keep certain files private or share them with selected clients only.

If a folder is hidden, it won’t appear among the visible folders in the gallery. It can only be accessed via a direct link — you can copy the link from the folder action menu. You can hide a single folder, multiple folders, or all folders at once.

### How to hide a single folder

Click the **(⋮)** icon next to the folder and choose **Hide folder**.

* When visiting the gallery, only public folders are shown.
* When following the direct link to a hidden folder, both public and that hidden folder will be visible.
* Once a hidden folder is opened, it stays visible in the folder list—even when switching to a public folder.

> Note: Only one hidden folder is remembered at a time, and only while the browser session is active.

### How to hide all folders

Hide all folders if you need to deliver files to multiple clients without exposing other folders. The gallery cover will still be visible to everyone.

To quickly get links to all folders, download the folder list in CSV format.

### Hidden folders and guest access

For large event galleries, you might want to make specific folders accessible only to certain people — the project client, the couple, etc.\
This can be done by enabling guest access.

Go to the project settings, open the **Privacy** tab, set a password, and enable the **Allow guest access** option.

{% hint style="info" %}
Anyone who enters the gallery using the password will see the hidden folders.
{% endhint %}



See an example gallery with guest access and a hidden folder:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3 public folders + 1 hidden folder</td><td><a href="https://gallery.wfolio.pro/disk/wedding-day">https://gallery.wfolio.pro/disk/wedding-day</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

Select **View as guest** or enter the password `123` to see hidden folders in guest mode.
