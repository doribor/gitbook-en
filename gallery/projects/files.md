#### Video playback

The gallery cover video always plays **without sound**.

Any video up to 3**00 MB** can be opened and viewed directly in the gallery.\
You can also enable **autoplay** for such videos — they will automatically play without sound while browsing the gallery.\
When clicked, the video opens in fullscreen mode, where it can be watched **with sound**.

Videos larger than 3**00 MB** are displayed with static covers.\
To view them, they must be **downloaded to the device**.

#### File link <a href="#file-link" id="file-link"></a>

For all photos, videos, and files up to 300 MB, a download link is generated. If someone follows the link, the file will automatically be downloaded to their device.

You can add this kind of link to a post-purchase action to deliver materials (for example, a PDF file) to clients.
