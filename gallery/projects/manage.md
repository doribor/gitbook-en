# Managing projects

In the admin panel, you can organize your photo sessions, change project settings, sort projects, and pin important ones to the top of the list.

### How to share a project

Click on the **Share** icon. You can copy the link to send to your client, download a QR code, or share the gallery directly via a messenger app like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Viber.

To share a project via messenger, the messenger app must be installed on your device.
{% endhint %}

### Project actions

Click on the **three dots (⋮)** next to any project to open the action menu.

Available options for each project include:

* **Settings.** Change the project name, description, access settings, and other parameters.
* **Preview.** Open the project in view mode to see how it looks from the client’s perspective.
* **Pin.** Pin up to three important projects to always display them at the top of your list.
* **Duplicate.** Create a copy of the project for easy editing. The copy does not include project files—you will need to upload them once more.
* <mark style="color:red;">**Delete.**</mark> Move the project to the trash.\
  You can restore it within 7 days; after that, it will be permanently deleted.

### Color labels

Use color labels (up to 5 colors) to organize projects. For example, by shoot type or priority orders.

To label a project, click on the dot next to it and choose a color.

### Sorting projects

Click the **Order by** button above the project list.

You can sort projects by:

* **Name.** Alphabetical order.
* **Size.**
* **Shoot date.** Set this when creating the project or in its settings.
* **Creation date.** Based on when the project was added to the cloud drive.
* **Expiration date.** Based on the end of the project’s storage period.
* **Label.** Group by color labels.
*   **Downloads.** Based on how many times the project archive has been downloaded.

    > Includes downloads of the full gallery, individual folders, or favorites lists\
    > Does _not_ include downloads of individual files—for those, view the stats inside the project.

You can choose the sort order:

* **Ascending.** A to Z, smaller to larger, older to newer, less popular to more popular.
* **Descending.** Z to A, larger to smaller, newer to older, more popular to less popular.
