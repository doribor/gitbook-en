# Managing files

### Selecting files

You can select files in several ways: by clicking, using keyboard shortcuts, or by category. Let’s take a closer look at each method.

#### Selecting individual files

Click on the the checkmark in the bottom-left corner of a file, or hold down **Ctrl** (or **Command** on Mac) and click on the files you want to select.

#### Selecting files using Shift

To select a range of files, click the checkmark on the first file, then hold down **Shift** and click the second file. This will select all files between the first and second, in order.

To add more files to your current selection, either click the checkmark on the additional files or hold **Ctrl/Command** and click on them.

#### Selecting by category or selecting all files

Click on the checkmark on any file, then tap **Select** at the bottom of the screen. Here you can choose to:

* Select only favorites.
* Select only non-favorites (files not added to the favorites list).
* Select all files in the folder.

If your project contains two or more folders, you can move files between them. To do this, select the files and click **Move** at the bottom of the screen. Then choose the destination folder.

### Deleting files

To delete multiple files at once, select the files and click on the <mark style="color:red;">**Delete**</mark> at the bottom of the screen. You will not be able to restore files once they are deleted from a project.

### Sorting files

Sorting buttons are located above the files at the top of the project and below them at the end of the project.

You can sort files by:

* **Title.**
* **Creation date.** Based on the upload date/time to the cloud drive.
* **Downloads.** By the number of downloads per file.
* **Favorites.** By the number of times a file was added to favorites.
* **EXIF date.** Based on the file's metadata.

Then choose the sorting order:

* **By ascendance.** A to Z, lower to higher, earlier to later, less popular to more popular.
* **By descendance.** Z to A, higher to lower, later to earlier, more popular to less popular.

### Shuffling files

Choose the **Shuffle** option to randomize the order of files.
