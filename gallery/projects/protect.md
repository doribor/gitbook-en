# Gallery protection

Your galleries are accessible via a unique direct link that you share with clients. Unlike website pages, galleries cannot be found through search engines thanks to built-in indexing protection.

### Security key for project address

This applies to all galleries. A unique security key is added to each gallery URL to prevent unauthorized access through link guessing.\
Example: _https://gallery.wfolio.pro/disk/project-**7dks03**_

This setting is enabled by default. You can manage the token in the **Drive settings** section.

### Watermark

Watermarks are enabled individually for each gallery. Go to the **Drive settings** section and upload a PNG watermark with a transparent background.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/watermark drive en.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once uploaded, you can adjust the watermark’s size and opacity.

To enable the watermark in a gallery:

* Go to the project settings.
* Disable the option to download original files.
* Activate **Add a watermark to the photo.**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/enable watermark in gallery en.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When selling digital photos, the watermark is applied automatically.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/photo selling watermark en.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The watermark appears as a grid overlay across all photos in the gallery.

### Password protection

Passwords are set individually for each gallery. In the project settings, go to the **Privacy** tab. Enable **Protect the project with a password** option and set the password.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/gallery password en.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Visitors will be prompted to enter the password before accessing the gallery.

Want to give a client access to hidden folders while keeping the rest of the gallery public? Use the [**guest access**](fidden-folders.md#hidden-folders-and-guest-access) feature.
