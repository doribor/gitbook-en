# Gallery description

A gallery on the cloud drive can have one or multiple folders. You can add a unique description to each folder to make the photo viewing experience more personal.

### Why add a description

A description is a great way to:

✔ Thank the client for the shoot and share warm words.\
✔ Remind them to follow you on social media.\
✔ Invite them to the next session or offer a discount.\
✔ Let them know they can order prints or purchase products at the bottom of the gallery.\
✔ Mention other photographers, organizers, or project participants.\
✔ Share any extra notes about the shoot or the photo selection process.

### How to add a description

* Open the gallery in the admin panel.
* Select the desired folder in the gallery.
* Click **Add description** and fill it in.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/add gallery description en.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Or click on the three dots **(⋮)** next to the folder and go to **Settings**.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/add gallery description folder en.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The description will be shown when viewing this folder in the gallery.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/gallery description example en.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Useful information

* The description is set **individually** for each folder.
* If you want to use the same descriptions in multiple galleries, you can create a gallery **template** with the required folders and descriptions: [template.md](../projects/template.md "mention").
