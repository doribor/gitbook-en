# Face Recognition

Face Recognition is a feature available only in cloud galleries. It analyzes people in the photos in your gallery and automatically groups images using artificial intelligence.

With this feature, your clients can quickly find all their photos, including group images where they appear.

## How to Enable

{% hint style="info" %}

After saving, the system will start analyzing the photos. Processing time depends on the number of files and faces in the project.

## How It Works for Your Client

After the analysis is complete, the **People in Photos** button appears in the client gallery. The button is available in both desktop and mobile versions.

Your client can:

* select themselves from the list of people;
* view only the photos with the selected person;
* download the selected images if you enabled the **Allow original file downloads** toggle.

If a face is not visible or is partially covered, the photo will not be included in the results.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In complex angles or profile shots, the same person may appear as multiple separate people.\
\
When there are more photos of the same person, the system more accurately groups them into one person.

## FAQ

**When do recognition results appear?**\
Analysis starts after you save the project settings. Processing time depends on the number of photos and faces. If results are not visible yet, the analysis is still in progress.

**Will the processing status be displayed?**\
Currently, the recognition progress indicator is not shown in the admin panel. The processing status display is planned for future updates.

**Why does the same person appear multiple times in the gallery?**\
This may happen with complex angles, profile shots, or when there are only a few photos of the person. The more photos of one person in the project, the more accurately the system groups them.

**Why was a face on a poster or inside another photo recognized?**\
The system analyzes facial features in the image. If a face is visible, even on a poster or in a reflection, it may be recognized as a separate person.

**Why is the feature not available on an unlimited plan?**\
The feature is available only in projects with a total number of files up to 1000. The limit includes all folders, including hidden ones, and files of all formats.
