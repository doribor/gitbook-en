# Downloading files from a gallery

By default, file downloading is **enabled**. If you want to disable it, see: [#how-to-disable-downloads](download.md#how-to-disable-downloads "mention").

### Original size and social media version

Photos can be downloaded in two formats:

* **Original size.**
* **Social media version.** Generates automatically for photos that are **2561px or larger** on the long side.

To enable social media versions, go to your **Drive settings**.

### Downloading individual files or ZIP archives

You can download files in two ways:

* **Individually**. By clicking the download icon next to each photo or file.
* **As a ZIP archive**. To download multiple files at once (e.g., a favorites list, a specific folder, or the entire gallery).

The ZIP archive will be saved to the device’s **Downloads** or **Files** folder. You’ll need to **extract the archive** before viewing the files.

### How to disable downloads

In your project settings (under the **General** tab), find the toggle **Allow download of originals**.\
Turn it off to disable photo downloads.

You can also enable a [watermark](../projects/protect.md#watermark) for additional protection.
