# Gallery cover

By default, the first **photo** or **video** in your project becomes the gallery cover.

### Setting up cover

* To change the cover, hover over the photo or video and click on the **Set as a cover** icon.

#### Video cover requirements

Upload a file in **MP4** or **MOV** format, up to **100 MB**.\
Supported video codecs: **h.264** or **AVC**.
{% endhint %}

### Cover image and social media link preview

When you share a link on social media, the gallery cover appears below the link—this is the link preview.

If the link has already been shared but you want to change the cover, make sure to **clear the cache** before sending it again. See [clear-cache.md](clear-cache.md "mention").

### Cover settings

Choose how the cover appears on desktop and mobile devices.

#### Cover darkening

The full-screen cover is displayed with a dark overlay, and the text on top of it is always white. This ensures that the text remains readable regardless of the photo.

To avoid the cover getting darkened, select the **Vertical** option for desktop and **Horizontal** for mobile.

You can also adjust the **focus point** of the cover if needed.

### Contact info and link on the cover

The cover displays your name and professional field—these can be set up in your **business card**.\
The website address shown on the cover can be edited in **Settings → Site address**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The link always leads to your business card or website. It cannot point to external resources like a Facebook profile.
{% endhint %}

#### How to hide contact info from the cover

Go to **Project settings → Contacts** and disable the toggle **Display your contact info**.
