# Videos in galleries

You can add videos to your galleries to share not just photos, but also dynamic content—such as teasers, behind-the-scenes clips, or video presentations.

#### Supported formats

Upload video files in one of the following formats:

✔ MP4.\
✔ MOV.

The video must be encoded with the **h.264 (AVC)** codec. This is a standard format supported by most devices and browsers.

### Video playback

Any video up to 300 MB is marked with the **Play** <i class="fa-play">:play:</i> icon and can be played directly in a gallery. You can also set up an autoplay feature for short videos. See more: [#short-video-autoplay](videos.md#short-video-autoplay "mention")

Other videos appear as static covers with the **Camera** <i class="fa-camera-movie">:camera-movie:</i>  icon. To watch them, the client needs to download the video to their device.



### Short video autoplay

In galleries, videos can play automatically if one of the following conditions is met:

* The video is set as the **gallery cover**. Starts playing automatically without sound when the client enters a gallery.
* **The video in a gallery is less than 300 MB**. You can enable autoplay feature by clicking on the autoplay icon above a video:
