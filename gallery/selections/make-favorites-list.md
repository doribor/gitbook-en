# Setting up selections

Clients can mark their favorite photos in the gallery, creating a **favorites list**. This list is available to them in the gallery and to you in the **project management panel**. It includes selected photos with their numbers, client comments, and contact details.

### Selection settings

Create a project on the **Drive** and upload files. Enable photo selections in the project settings.

#### Limit selection

Enable the **Limit the number of photos for selection** option and set the desired value.

#### Allow commenting

If enabled, clients can leave comments on selected photos after adding them to their list.

#### How clients can comment on photos

To leave a comment, the client needs to click the **comment icon** in the low left corner of the photo.

✔ On **desktop**, this option appears right after the photo is added to favorites.\
✔ On **mobile**, the client first needs to open the list of selected photos.
{% endhint %}

#### Client name format <a href="#client-name" id="client-name"></a>

Clients are always prompted to enter their **name**—this helps identify the favorites list.\
Go to **Drive settings** to choose how the name request appears during favorites selection and [digital photo purchases](../../shop/gallery/digital-photos.md).

This is useful if you want to request just a **First name** or ask for **Last name, First name** in a strict order.

#### Collect clients' data

Additionally, you can request their **email** and **phone number** if needed. To collect additional details, enable the **Request a comment from the client** option.

### How it works

* When a client clicks on the **heart icon** for the first time, a favorites list is created. They must enter their **name** and any additional details you set up earlier.
* To view all selected photos, clients can click on the **heart icon** in the top-right corner (on desktop) or at the bottom of the screen (on mobile).
* Clients can **leave comments** by clicking the comment icon on a photo. On mobile version, comment icons are displayed in the favorites list.
* Clients can save the login link to their favorites page. This way they can continue selection later.
* Clicking on the **Complete the Selection** button changes the status from **In Process** to **Completed**. You will receive an email notification.

When the selection is completed, new photos cannot be added. You can reopen the selection on the control panel.

### Favorites lists in the control panel

View all created lists in the **Favorites** tab within the project.

At the bottom of each list, you will see the client's **contact information** and their **comment on the selection**. Individual photo comments are displayed next to the respective images.

Below is an example of how the list appears in your panel. When creating her list, Hild provided her **email, phone number, and delivery address** for a photo book.

* **Table View** displays selections in a structured format. Comments are displayed next to photos.

* **Tiles View** shows images in a visually appealing layout. To view comments, hover over the comment icon.

You can also create a selection list in advance via the control panel by clicking on **Add List**, then send the client a ready-made link.
