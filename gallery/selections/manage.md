# Actions with selections

Favorites lists make it easy to organize selected photos for retouching, printing, or other tasks.\
This article covers what actions you can perform with individual and multiple favorites lists.

### Actions for a single list

In the **Favorites** section of your project, click on the three dots **(⋮)** next to a list to open the action menu. Then select an action.

* **Preview**. View how the list will appear to the client.
* **Settings**. Rename the list, add or remove list comment, and manage access.
* **Copy link**. Copy the link to share the favorites list with the client.
* **Download files**. Download all files from the list as a ZIP archive.
* **File list in CSV**. Export the list to share it with retouchers or event organizers.
* **Lightroom & Capture One**. Get filenames for quick filtering and editing in these apps.
* **Duplicate list**. Create a copy of the list; useful if you want to edit it while keeping the original.

#### Access control

* **Allow selection**. Allows the client to add or remove photos in the list.
* **Complete selection**. Locks the list; the client can view it but can’t make changes.

By default, file downloading is allowed if it’s enabled for the entire gallery.\
However, you can [disable downloads for a gallery](../share/download.md#how-to-disable-downloads) but override it for favorites lists by selecting the actions:

* **Allow downloads**. Clients can download the files in the list.
* **Disable downloads**. Prevents clients from downloading files from this list.

#### <mark style="color:red;">Deleting a list</mark>

* **Delete list and files**. Completely removes the list and its files. This action cannot be undone.
* **Delete list only**. Removes the list but keeps the files in the project.



### Actions for all lists

In the **Favorites** section, click on the three dots **(⋮)** in the top-right corner to open the menu for all project lists.

* **Download files**. Download all favorites lists with their files in one ZIP archive.
* **Lightroom & Capture One**. Export filenames from all lists for editing in those programs.
* **Export selection data to CSV**. See [csv.md](csv.md "mention").

#### Access control for all lists

* **Open all lists**. Allows all clients to make changes to their lists.
* **Complete all lists**. Locks all lists so no further edits can be made.

#### <mark style="color:red;">Deleting all lists</mark>

The **Delete all lists** action removes all lists and their selection data. <mark style="color:red;">**This cannot be undone.**</mark> The photos themselves will remain in the gallery.
