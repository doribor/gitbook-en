# How to enable download for a single favorites list

You can protect photos in your gallery from being downloaded and optionally enable a watermark. Learn more here: [protect.md](../projects/protect.md "mention").

If you want to give download access to some files while keeping the rest protected, you can allow downloads for a specific **favorites list**.

{% hint style="success" %}
This setting is available for galleries with downloading **disabled**.

If photo downloading is enabled, all favorites lists can be downloaded by default.
{% endhint %}

How to enable download for a favorites list:

* Open the project and go to the **Favorites** tab.
* Click the three dots **(⋮)** next to the desired list.
* Select **Allow download.**

Photos from that list can now be downloaded in original quality or resized, while the rest of the gallery remains protected.
