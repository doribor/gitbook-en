# Reviews

Reviews help build trust and show future clients what it's like to work with you. They also have a positive impact on your website’s search engine visibility!

### Where clients can leave a review

✔ In the **gallery on the cloud drive**—either after downloading their photos or by clicking on the **Review** button.\
✔ On the **reviews page** of your website.

Clients fill out a form with their **name** (required) and an optional **social media link**. If they’re submitting a review via the website, they can also upload an **avatar** or a personal photo.

Minimum review length is **30 characters**.

### Collecting reviews via the galleries

By default, reviews are enabled for all galleries.\
After clicking **Download**, a pop-up window asks the client to leave a review.

<i class="fa-lightbulb">:lightbulb:</i> Write a short, motivating message. Personalize it for each shoot if possible.

You can manage or disable review collection in the **project settings → Reviews** tab.\
To disable the review request **only after downloads**, toggle off **Ask for review after download**.

### Managing reviews

All reviews appear in the admin panel. You can:

* **Edit**. Fix typos, change the avatar or link. Click on the three dots next to a review → **Edit**.
* **View details**. Go to the **Info** tab in the review editor to see the date/time, IP address, and submission page.
* <mark style="color:red;">**Delete**</mark>. Click on the three dots → **Delete**. Deleted reviews **cannot be recovered**.

{% hint style="success" %}
If the review was submitted via a gallery, it **won’t be deleted** when the gallery expires.
{% endhint %}

### Moderation and publication

All reviews must be approved by you before appearing on the website. New, unpublished reviews are highlighted in blue.

To publish a review, enable the **Published** toggle.

Publishing reviews is currently **not available** on the Drive Only plans. This will be added in future updates.

#### Video reviews

You can publish **video reviews** (horizontal format). Click on the **Add** → **Video review** on the Reviews page.

#### Attaching reviews to pages

You can attach a review to a blog post or a [story](site/stories/previews.md) where you’ve published photos from the shoot.\
More details here: [respond-to-customer-review.md](site/stories/respond-to-customer-review.md "mention").

#### Embedding reviews on any page

You can embed reviews into any **custom** page:

* Add a new block to your page.
* Go to the **Widgets** tab.
* Select the **Embed reviews** block.

#### Review categories

You can create categories for your reviews. They’ll be shown on the reviews page to help clients browse (e.g., _Weddings_, _Family sessions_). Learn more here: [categories.md](site/stories/categories.md "mention").

### Frequently asked questions

* **If I delete the gallery, will the review be deleted too?**\
  No! Reviews and avatars remain even after the gallery is deleted.
* **I deleted a review by mistake. Can I recover it?**\
  Unfortunately, no. Deleted reviews cannot be restored.
* **Why is the gallery cover showing as the avatar?**\
  The gallery cover is used as the default avatar.\
  You can replace it by uploading a different image or portrait photo.
* **Can I remove the minimum character limit?**\
  No, this limit ensures clients leave meaningful reviews—not just a single word like _Thanks_.
* **Can I show the date of the review on the website?**\
  Wfolio does not display review dates so they always look fresh.\
  However, you can manually include the date in the review text if you’d like.
* **Can I add screenshots to the reviews page?**\
  No, but you can copy the message text and add it manually.\
  Text-based reviews are better for SEO. Search engines can read text but can’t index text in images like screenshots.\
  If you really want to show screenshots, you can place them on a [custom page](site/pages/custom-page.md) instead.
