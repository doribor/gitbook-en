### Visitor statistics

#### Unique visitors

The number of new visitors. Each visitor is counted once per **24 hours**, even if they return multiple times within that period.

#### Total visits

The total number of visits, counted every 30 minutes from the same device or browser.

#### Total pageviews

The number of pages viewed by all visitors. Every page transition is recorded as a new view.

#### Views per visit

The average number of pages a visitor views per session, including repeat views of the same page.

#### Bounce rate

The percentage of visitors who viewed only one page before leaving.\
A high bounce rate can have different reasons:

* Visitors didn't find the needed information or a relevant link, so they left.
* Visitors found all the information they needed on the page (common for one-page websites or landing pages) and closed the site.

### Traffic sources

#### Direct / None

Visitors who accessed your site via:

* A direct link (e.g., bookmarks or typing the URL in the browser).
* Messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram), or email links.
* Undetectable sources (e.g., visitors using privacy extensions that block tracking).

#### Search engines

Traffic from Google, Bing, and other search platforms.

#### Social media & services

Visitors coming from YouTube, Pinterest, Facebook, etc.

#### Referral websites

Visitors who came from another site.\
For example, if you have a portfolio on Behance, traffic from Behance will be recorded as `behance.net`.
