# How to install Facebook pixel

Pixel is an analytics tool that allows you to track all website visitors. As soon as a person visits a page of your website, the pixel automatically remembers this visit and the user's id on the social network. After collecting an audience of website visitors, you can set up a flexible advertising campaign for the selected audience on social networks.

The pixel is worth installing on your site **anyway**, even if you don't plan on launching ads anytime soon. **The ability to form the necessary audience for an advertising campaign in the future will be very useful.**

### **Why and how to use a pixel**

The main idea is to gather the audience that was on your website or drive, and then make advertising offers for them on social networks effectively and targeted. A few examples of using the information collected with the pixel:

* **Remind about yourself.** You will be able to remind of yourself to users who have visited your website on a regular basis. Advertising to this audience will be much more effective than regular advertising.
* **Build an audience of clients' friends.** If you use <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (408).png" alt="" data-size="line"> [**Cloud Drive**](https://wfolio.com/my/disk) to regularly transfer images, and your customers share the link with friends, then you can also collect them into a separate audience and prepare special offers for them.
* **Visiting certain pages.** You will be able to prepare individual, promotional offers for visitors to certain pages. For example, make an ad with a promotion for all visitors who have visited the services page in the last 30 days.
* **Make a birthday promotion.** Make a special offer for users who have visited your website and who will have a birthday soon.
* **Launch a catch-up campaign.** Make catch-up advertising campaigns for specific goods and services. For example, a visitor was interested in a preset or video tutorial on your website, but left it. You will be able to show him an advertisement on a social network with the offer he was interested in.
