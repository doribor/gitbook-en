# Cookie Notice

Cookies are small text files stored in a visitor’s browser. They collect statistical data and enhance the browsing experience by improving site loading speed.

Cookies may contain data that qualifies as personal information (such as IP addresses or device identifiers). It is important to notify visitors about cookies to comply with personal data protection laws.



### How to enable Cookie Notice

* Go to the **Settings → Legal settings**.
* Enable **Show cookie consent banner** toggles in the **Visitor Notifications** section. Cookie notice can be activated both for a website and for galleries.

If a [privacy policy](consent.md) is published, the banner will include a link to the document. If there is no policy, a notification text will be shown without a link.

**The notification text is not editable.**



### How it looks

The notification appears in the lower right corner and matches your website or gallery style.

{% hint style="info" %}
The setting **informs** visitors about cookie usage. To allow visitors to **manage** their cookie preferences, integrate a [cookie management service](cookie-consent-manager.md). This is especially important if the website collects data from EU citizens, as GDPR regulations apply.
